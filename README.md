GUSAC, abbreviated as GITAM Universityâ€™s Science and Activity Center, is one of the most happening student organizations, serves as home to a vibrant array of programs and services that focus on academic enrichment, campus, and community engagement, and cultural and identity exploration for all GITAM students. Dating back to 2011, a few students from our university determined to bring about a change in society, believed that collaborating students from various domains and working on the socio-environmental concerns would result in a never seen before insight and solutions to those problems. Thence, GUSAC (GITAM University's Science and Activity Center), a student organization with its motto "it's not what you know, it's what you do with what you know." was founded on the premises of the University.
